## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Gridbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was similar to the other card challenges I submitted. I decided to challenge myself to exclusively use CSS Gridbox to layout the card instead of relying on Flexbox. My understanding of how CSS Gridbox is better, but there are certain properties I'm still confused.

I had a hard time figuring out how to vertically center the cards on larger screens with just CSS GridBox. I ended up relying on using flexbox on the parent element, body, to center it. Once I figure out a solution I can center it with the .card container, I will update this!
